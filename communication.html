      Good morning, everyone! My name is M.V.S.K.VALLABHA RAYUDU, and I am from
      Vijayawada. I graduated in 2021 with a B.Tech in Civil Engineering from
      Dhanekula Institute of Engineering & Technology, affiliated with JNTUK.
      During my final year, I undertook a project on the Design and Analysis of
      a Multi-storied Residential Building using Staad Pro and AutoCAD. Beyond
      academics, I am passionate about playing chess, Sudoku, and other brain
      games, which fuel my creativity. I had the opportunity to work as an Area
      Technical Engineer at India Cements Pvt Ltd., where I gained experience in
      Techno Sales and improved my communication skills through daily
      interactions with various people. My involvement in brain games has honed
      my decision-making skills. In the short term, my goal is to secure a job
      in software, and in the long term, I aspire to inspire new entrants in the
      software field. I am known for my patience and am eager to learn from the
      engaging journey ahead. Thank you for your time.
